## 2026-01-17 - Slowloris DoS Protection **Vulnerability:** The single-threaded `service` script was vulnerable to a Slowloris-style Denial of Service attack. A malicious client could hold a connection open indefinitely by sending data very slowly (e.g., 1 byte every 0.5s), preventing the server from accepting new connections because `socket_timeout` only applies to individual `recv` operations, not the total connection duration. **Learning:** Single-threaded servers are highly susceptible to resource exhaustion attacks where clients hold resources. Per-operation timeouts are insufficient; a global connection deadline is required. **Prevention:** Implemented `MAX_CONNECTION_DURATION` (60s) to forcibly close connections that take too long, ensuring the server remains available.
